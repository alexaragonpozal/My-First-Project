            <h3>A hopeless daydreamer finds sense in the world through his art</h3>

            <p>My name is Tomás and I am a UX/UI designer. Having recently graduated from Ironhack Tech Bootcamp in Lisbon, I was introduced to the world of user-centered design in an immersive experience, having acquired knowledge over the course of seven different projects and over 350 hours.
            <span class="key-attributes"> <strong>User Research, User Experience and User Interface</strong> were the main focus of the Bootcamp, having provided the necessary tools for any job in the industry</span>
